I am Xuechun Xu, and on May 24th, 2024, I completed my PhD in the Information Science and Engineering division at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden, under the supervision of Professor Joakim Jaldén. My research revolves around the development of interpretative models and high-performance algorithms for nanopore sequencing. My dissertation, [Algorithms and Models in Nanopore DNA Sequencing: Advanced Decoding and Modeling with Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-346051) includes two interpretable stochastic models to characterize the underlying process of nanopore sequencing and high-performance algorithms to handle large-scale inference problems in basecalling.

I graduated from the Master's program in System, Control and Robotics at KTH, Sweden, in 2018 and from the Bachelor's program in Mechatronics Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University, China, in 2016. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about the realms of art and video games. I also play badminton and electric guitar.
