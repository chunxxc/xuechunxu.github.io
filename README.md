# About Me

**About Me** | [CV](https://chunxxc.github.io/chunxxc.github.io/CV.html) | [Gallery](https://chunxxc.github.io/chunxxc.github.io/hobbies.html)

My name is Xuechun Xu, and I am currently a PhD candidate at the Information Science and Engineering division of the [Royal Institute of Technology, KTH](https://www.kth.se/en), under the invaluable guidance of Professor [Joakim Jaldén](https://www.kth.se/profile/jalden). I expect to defend my doctoral dissertation in March 2024. My research project focuses on developing interpretative models and high-performance algorithms for nanopore sequencing. Together with Joakim, we developed two large-scale stochastic models characterising the undergoing process of nanopore sequencing. The first model combines an explicit duration Hidden Markov model (HMM) with a deep neural network, while the second model is a massive-state hierarchical HMM. Complementing these models, we also designed Marginalized Beam Search addressing the infeasible maximum a posteriori criteria applicable to such large-scale models. All models and algorithms are accelerated by GPU.

I graduated from the Master's program in System, Control and Robotics at KTH, Sweden, in 2018 and from the Bachelor's program in Mechatronics engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University, China, in 2016. Aside from research, I am also a passionate artist and gamer. The fantasy world of colour leads me from solitude. I also play badminton and electric guitar.
