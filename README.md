I am Xuechun Xu, a current PhD candidate affiliated with the Information Science and Engineering division of the [Royal Institute of Technology, KTH](https://www.kth.se/en). I have been privileged to work under Professor [Joakim Jaldén](https://www.kth.se/profile/jalden) and am on track to defend my doctoral dissertation in March 2024. 

My research revolves around the development of interpretative models and high-performance algorithms for nanopore sequencing. Collaborating closely with Professor Jaldén, we developed two large-scale stochastic models characterising the underlying process of nanopore sequencing. The first model is EDHMM-DNN and the second model is a massive-state HHMM. We also designed Marginalized Beam Search approximating the infeasible MAP criteria applicable to such large-scale models. Notably, all our models and algorithms are accelerated by GPU/CUDA.

I graduated from the Master's program in System, Control and Robotics at KTH, Sweden, in 2018 and from the Bachelor's program in Mechatronics Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University, China, in 2016. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about the realms of art and games. I also play badminton and electric guitar.
