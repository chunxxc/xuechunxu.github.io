# About Me

**About Me** | [Painting](https://mrcatmeowy.github.io/snowlwebsite/hobbies.html)

I am a PhD candidate at the Information Science and Engineering division of the [Royal Institute of Technology, KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) and expect to defend my doctoral dissertation in March 2023. My research project focuses on developing interpretative models and high-performance algorithms for nanopore sequencing. Under the invaluable guidance of Professor [Joakim Jaldén](https://www.kth.se/profile/jalden), we developed two large-scale stochastic models characterising the undergoing process of nanopore sequencing.

Our first model combines an explicit duration Hidden Markov model (HMM) with a deep neural network, while the second model is a massive-state hierarchical HMM. Complementing these models, we also designed decoding algorithms capable of addressing the infeasible maximum a posteriori criteria applicable to such large-scale models. These efforts have already resulted in two journal papers under review and another journal paper, currently in progress.
